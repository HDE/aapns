Installation
============

Requirements
------------

Python 3.8 or 3.9 and ``asyncio``.

Tested on Linux and macOS. Core code will work anywhere where ``asyncio`` works, however functional tests require a POSIX system.


Installation
------------

``pip install aapns``

If you wish to use the command line interface, use ``pip install aapns[cli]``
